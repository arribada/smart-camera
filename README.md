Motion app - performs motion detection over a given perimeter
Classify app - using neural network trained on Edge Impulse to detect objects in images from the input folder. Saves the images in which the objects of interest were found on "detected" folder
Upload app - upload images from "detected" folder to Edge Impulse Addnotation Queue
Upload Telegram - upload images from "detected" folder to Telegram group
